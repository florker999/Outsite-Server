# Backend Server for Next.js App with MongoDB, User Management (AWS Cognito)

This repository contains the backend server for a Next.js application. It's built with Node.js and TypeScript, and provides the following functionalities:

* **API Endpoint Handling:** Processes API calls originating from the frontend Next.js application.
* **MongoDB Integration:** Connects to and interacts with a MongoDB database for data persistence.
* **User Management:** Implements secure user registration, authentication, and authorization leveraging AWS Cognito.

It serves as an excercise for creating custom server, since Next.js server actions could handle the tasks on their own.

## Technologies Used

* **Node.js:** JavaScript runtime environment for server-side execution.
* **TypeScript:** Superset of JavaScript that adds static typing.
* **Express.js:** Minimalist and flexible Node.js web application framework.
* **MongoDB:** NoSQL document database.
* **AWS Cognito:** Provides secure user directories that scale to millions of users.
